    <h2>Biggest Wars in History</h2>
    <p>They are the biggest wars in history because they involved most of the world’s major countries and caused massive destruction. Both wars used advanced technology, huge armies, and global alliances. Millions of soldiers and civilians were affected, and battles took place in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The financial cost, human loss, and worldwide consequences were greater than any other conflicts in history.</p>
    <h3>Why did they happen</h3>
    World War I happened because of nationalism, militarism, rivalries, and the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Countries were competing for power and land, and alliances pulled everyone into war.
World War II happened because of the rise of dictators, economic problems after WWI, and Hitler’s desire to expand Germany. The League of Nations failed to stop aggression, and the invasion of Poland finally triggered the war.
