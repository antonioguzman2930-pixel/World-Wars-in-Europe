            <h2>Sequence of Events</h2>
        <h3>Start</h3>
        World War I began in 1914 after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in Sarajevo. Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia for the attack and used it as a reason to declare war. This small conflict quickly grew because the major European powers were connected through alliances and rivalries. Germany supported Austria-Hungary, while Russia supported Serbia. France and Britain then joined to help their allies. Deep causes such as militarism, nationalism, and competition for colonies created tension for years, so when the assassination happened, it acted like a spark in a room full of explosives. Within weeks, almost all of Europe was at war, turning a local event into a global conflict.

        <h3>Alliances</h3>
        During World War I, two major alliance systems divided Europe and helped turn a regional conflict into a global war. On one side was the Triple Entente, which included France, Russia, and Great Britain; these nations cooperated to stop German expansion and maintain a balance of power. On the other side was the Triple Alliance, formed by Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy, although Italy later switched sides. These alliances meant that when one country was attacked or declared war, its partners were pulled into the conflict, causing the war to expand quickly across the continent.

        <h3>Climax</h3>
            The climax of World War I came in 1918, when both sides launched massive offensives to decide the outcome of the war. Germany pushed forward with the Spring Offensive, hoping to break the Allied lines before American troops arrived in full force. For a moment, it seemed like Germany might win—but the Allies fought back with the Hundred Days Offensive, pushing German forces backward again and again. The battles were intense, deadly, and fast-moving, marking the turning point when it became clear that Germany could no longer continue fighting.

        <h3>decline</h3>
            The decline of World War I began in late 1918, when Germany and its allies were running out of soldiers, supplies, and morale. The arrival of fresh American troops strengthened the Allies, while Germany faced food shortages and growing protests at home. Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire started to collapse, leaving Germany isolated. As the Allied forces pushed forward, it became clear that the Central Powers could no longer continue fighting.

        <h3>End</h3>
            The end of World War I came on November 11, 1918, when Germany signed the Armistice after months of military defeats and internal chaos. Fighting stopped at 11 a.m., bringing relief to millions of soldiers on the front lines. Soon after, peace negotiations led to the Treaty of Versailles, which redrew borders, punished Germany with heavy reparations, and created the League of Nations. Although the war had ended, Europe was left deeply damaged and unstable.

        <H2>Legacy</H2>
        <p>The legacy of World War I was powerful and long-lasting. The war caused the fall of empires, such as Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, and changed borders across Europe and the Middle East. It also led to new technologies, social changes, and a rise in movements for independence around the world. However, the harsh conditions placed on Germany created anger and economic problems, which later helped spark World War II. Even today, World War I is remembered for its massive destruction and the lessons it taught about global conflict.</p>
